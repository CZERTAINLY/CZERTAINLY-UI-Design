# CZERTAINLY-UI-Design

[![View in Figma](https://img.shields.io/badge/Figma-Open%20File-purple)](https://www.figma.com/design/qGPoVDkYFM9j7GFbkJK5uu/Main)

This repo tracks UI changes to CZERTAINLY’s Figma library via change-YAML files—no binary blobs here.


This repository contains UI design for the CZERTAINLY platform.
Design files are available publicly for transparent contribution.

## Where I can find all design files?

The following design files are available:

| Design File | Short Description |
|-------------|-------------------|
| [Main](https://www.figma.com/design/qGPoVDkYFM9j7GFbkJK5uu/Main) | Main design file for the CZERTAINLY UI |
| [Components Library](https://www.figma.com/design/Z2ZXpUFRa26L7NTLt5ufhe/Component-Library) | Library file containing design components used |

All files have public access and they can be saved as a local copy.
Direct manipulation is prohibited and we do not provide other access to design files due to open source nature of the project.

Design files are binaries that can be large, and therefore this repostiory does not contain these files stored in the change history.
Instead of this, each contribution and change contains link to the publicly available changes and files to keep the complete history.

## How to contribute

1. **Duplicate** the design file into your drafts.
2. Make your edits in Figma
3. Populate new `changes/<brief>/change.yaml`
4. Fork this repo, commit that YAML (no design binaries!), and open a PR
5. CI will auto-validate your schema

We keep the complete history of changes using the pull requests for tracking purposes and reconstruction of events.
